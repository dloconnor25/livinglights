         <h2>The Glowworm</h2>
         <p>The glowworms found in the Waitomo and Ruakuri caves are the larvae of a species of gnat called Arachnocampa luminosa, which is unique to New Zealand. These insects spend most of their life as larvae (juveniles), growing to the size of a matchstick.</p>

         <p>The angry-looking anglerfish has a right to be cranky. It's quite possibly the ugliest animal on the planet, living in what is easily Earth's most inhospitable habitat: the lonely, lightless bottom of the sea.

<h2>The scorpion</h2>
  <p>Scientists know why scorpions are fluorescent like this, because of a nitrogenous substance in its cuticles, but what’s not known with any certainty is whether there is any purpose behind the fluorescence (other than to make it easy for humans to find them in the dark). “It’s a really easy thing to,” Marek said. “You go out at night into the Sonoran Desert with one of these UV lights and … these scorpions light up and glow like a little star field on the ground.” </p>

<h2>The FIRE FLY</h2>
  <p>The method by which fireflies produce light is perhaps the best known example of bioluminescence. When oxygen combines with calcium, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the chemical luciferin in the presence of luciferase, a bioluminescent enzyme, light is produced. </p>

<div class="textInfo">
  <h2>More animal information</h2>
  <p>Bioluminescence is light emitting from a living organism. Bioluminescence is produced through a chemical reaction, which is what sets is apart from fluorescence or phosphorescence. Luciferin and luciferase are the two chemicals that must be present for an organism to luminesce. Luciferin produces the light and luciferase is the catalyst. Life in the sea most often use coelenterazine, a type of luciferin. Sailors commonly saw waves glowing in the wake of ships. This was caused from dinoflagellates, a single-celled algae, which glows when they're startled.</p><br>
  <div class="hide">
    <p>
Insects (e.g., fireflies, glow worms) and deep sea ocean animals (e.g., squid, hatchetfish) aren’t the only ones that emit light. Many plants (e.g., jack-o’-lantern mushroom, algae) also produce bioluminescence. Anglerfish use a long illuminated appendage, called a protuberance, to attract young and vulnerable prey. Luring prey is one way bioluminescence is used to an animal’s advantage. They may also use it to stun prey or to attract or recognize a mate.
Conversely, many animals use bioluminescence as a defense mechanism. They’ll cleverly create smoke screens or burglar alarms, as well as counterilluminate or startle predators.
Some animals that luminesce use it defensively and offensively.
Sperm whales, the deepest divers of all the whales, depend on bioluminescence to help locate food. Echolocation is also key to locating food.
The U.S. Navy tapped into the science community for help to develop products that monitor bioluminescence because bioluminescent algae have been known to endanger military missions.
The pulsing light of creatures found in the deep sea is “perhaps the most common form of communication found on our planet”.</p>
